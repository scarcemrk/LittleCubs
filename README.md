# Web Design Problem 1 - Playhouse
## Website Title: Little Cubs
### Description
Little Cubs is a kindergarten academy. I chose pokeball as logo because it is the
most popular cartoon Pokémon's part and all children’s favorite cartoon also. I
added Little Cubs text in the bottom of pokeball.
The landing page is designed to keep in mind both types of customers
1. First Time Visitors
2. Regular Visitors

This layout allows the visitors to see how Little Cubs is the best kindergarten for
his/her child.
The cartoon's themes and white background looks nice and eye friendly for users.
The contact section consists of all the information that customers may be looking
for including the address on google map and the social media.
